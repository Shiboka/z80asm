# Z80 Assembler

Just something I've been working on, still a work in progress. Sorry if it's a bit hard to understand, it does need some love.

It's still a bit finicky with what it will build, in the examples folder is a working hello world.
It outputs a raw Z80 binary file, what I do to test it is convert it to a ZX Spectrum tape image and run it in Fuse, but I'm sure there are other emulators that would work.
