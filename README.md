# Z80 Assembler

Just something I've been working on, still a work in progress. The code is a mess in spots, needs a good refactoring, sorry if it's a bit unreadable. Some variables should be renamed, they are a bit ambiguous atm.

It's still a bit finicky with what it will build, in the examples folder is an example of a working hello world.
It outputs a raw Z80 binary file, what I do to test it is convert it to a ZX Spectrum tape image and run it in Fuse, but I'm sure there are other emulators that would work.
